very mentally ill genderless animal girl thing ✦ lesbian ✦ pro-kink/pro-fiction ✦ fuck bioessentialism

i really like madoka, pokemon the critters, and my siblings (found incest)
<br> i also like mlp, made in abyss, nier, touhou, rain world, saya no uta, voice synth (miku, teto, etc), 2000-2010s internet stuff, furries...</br>

we can talk about life or anything you want. don't be afraid to "traumadump" me!!! we can also talk kinks idm, though i don't really do roleplay

it's fine if you copy my skins (i'd be flattered ///) most of them can be found in a folder in the repo of my profile

i'm too lazy to code this so yeah
